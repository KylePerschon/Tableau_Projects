# Hierarchy Graph
The Hierarchy Graph example shows how we can take any list of items (within Pythons recursion bounds (3000 nested)) and turn it into a tree-hierarchy styled graph. This can be useful when you are trying to vizualize the relationship between one or many nodes. The code will take the list of relationships (start and end points) and turn that into an X,Y cordinate pair graph that does not allow for overlap. The dataset can be easily imported into Tableau, and after dropping a few simple pills.. You have a beautiful tree-hierarchy chart!
